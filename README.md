# Code Project
The project is named DEDICATE  DElta DIraC ApproximaTions Equations

This code represents a set of scripts in Python for simulating convective and diffusive PDE, in 1-2-3 dimensions, with a sink or source modeled by a Dirac Delta function.

This project has various specific `README` in the project structure.
A  `README` in the main source code folder `dedicate_code`, describing the overall folders and portions of the pipeline.
Each of the 5 python modules is described in this read me.
A  `README` in `data` folder ideally describes the content of what soul be present in that folder. The data provided is generated by the code and can be regenerated for testing purposes.


## Code Development
This code has to be intended developed with 1-day sprints, so code is modular, and after a year-long development all these pieces are gathered together in this pipeline project.

## Code structure
The modular code can test multiple delta regularizations with scaled supports.  Tune the tests with multiple PDE solvers, or evaluate the performance on different PDEs that can also be time-dependent. 

### Data ETL
This step involves creating multiple types of mesh:
* in 1D, 2D, 3D, 
* equally spaced or not


### Delta Exploration
* PLots of different delta

### Feature Engineering
Contains the solver part.
This part solves the PDE with FiPy: possible solvers are: scipy, petscy or pyamgx.
PDE can be diffusive and/or convective.

### Tests
Generates all possible tests, of convergence and error estimations.
<!---
TODO
This part should be better commented on. Please write any doubt on this project.

## Version information

Minium system requirements:
* Python 3.4
As for Pathlib, better to use Python 3.6 (>3.4), the pathlib module is supported throughout the standard library, partly due to the addition of a file system path protocol [see](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/).
* on readme_conda_python_configs you can find the installations steps, and the used packages are in DEDICATE-environment.yml
